## About Me

Hi, I'm Kaushik! I'm an undergrad majoring in Computer Science + Linguistics at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign. In summer 2024, I was an intern for Arm's [TOSA](https://www.mlplatform.org/tosa/) group in San Jose, CA. I'm also a research assistant in the [ADAPT Group](https://adapt.cs.illinois.edu/), a course assistant for [CS 374 (Intro Algorithms)](https://cs.illinois.edu/academics/courses/cs374), and a chair of [ACM @ UIUC](https://www.acm.illinois.edu/)'s infrastructure committee.
